  <p><strong class="unresponsive-council-name">Your council</strong> is one of only <strong>2%</strong> of councils that don’t accept reports from FixMyStreet. We’re sad about it too, but here’s some things you can do now:</p>

  <a href="#" class="unresponsive-council-cta unresponsive-council-cta--primary">
    <strong>Report your issue directly</strong> to <span class="unresponsive-council-name">the council</span> on their website
  </a>

  <h2>If you’d prefer to use FixMyStreet next time:</h2>

  <a href="#" class="unresponsive-council-cta">
    <strong>Write to your MP or local councillors</strong> to let them know this isn’t okay
  </a>

  <a href="#" class="unresponsive-council-cta">
    <strong>Tweet</strong> to let <span class="unresponsive-council-name">your council</span></strong> know you’d rather use FixMyStreet
  </a>
